In this project, our group was tasked with making a model to fit a dataset of our choosing and analyze trends in the response variable(s). 

We selected a dataset about Taiwanese Bankruptcy, which we found from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository publically. 

This dataset had 94 predictors, which we took on as a challenge to discover which ones were most significant. 

Our group used a Logistic Regression model to complete the project, as our response variable had a binary outcome detailing if the company was bankrupt or not. 

Our code, the dataset, and the slides are uploaded within this repository.
